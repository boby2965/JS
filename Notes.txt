---------------------- Java Script ------------------

--> Java Script is a light weight (Just-In-Time) JIT interepted programming language.
--> JIT is the process of translating code in browser.
--> Interpeted is the process of line-by-line translation.
--> Several technologies use JavaScript with a compiler and AOT techniques.
--> JavaScript compilers are  : Babel & V8
--> AOT means Ahead-of-Time, code is compiles at application level.

--> JavaScript is a language used in various application environments
                1) Client side          - HTML, Angular, React,Vue     **(Currently used in this course)**
                2) Server side          - NodeJS
                3) Database             - MongoDB
                4) Animations           - Flash, 3DS Max, CAD systems 

--> JavaScript supports various prgraming approaches
                1) Functional programming
                2) Structural programming
                3) imperative pr0gramming
                4) Object Oriented Programming etc ..

Note:- JS is not an OOP language. It Just supports only few features of OOP.

----------------  JavaScript Client Side ----------------

--> JS is used on client side to reduce the burden on server.
--> It reduces round trips.
--> It can reduce burden on server by handling various interactions on client side.

--> JS is used client side with HTML for :
                1. DOM Manipulations
                2. Client Side interactions
                3. Client Side Validations

        --> DOM manipulations include 
                1. Adding element into DOM
                2. Removing element into DOM
                3. Updating data into DOM

        --> Client Side interactions include
                1. location access
                2. Navigation access
                3. History access
                4. Plugins, MIME Types etc..
        
        --> Client Side Validations is the process of verifying user input to ensure
            that contradictory and unauthorized data is not stored into Database.
